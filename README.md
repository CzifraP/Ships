My Ship designs

I'm a totally amateur designer from Hungary. I've decided to design a sculling boat for minimum two persons. 
My design principles are:
  - lightweight
  - DIY
  - easy to care
  - easy to carry
  
There are two main topics, one is the hull design itself and the second are the seats. The main idea at the hull design is the modularity.
I use the same widht along the middle of the boat. I plan 1500 mm long sections in the middle for the seats. I plan approx. 500 mm the distance between the frames.
Each seat is one modul. The seat consist the tracks, rowing seat, foot stretcher and riggers or this is just a seat for coxswain. You can mount the easily seats according your needs.
